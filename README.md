Abstract :
The proposed system utilizes laser line projection and an artificial neural network (ANN) for obstacle detection. 
It captures an image with a laser line projected onto the object, detects the laser line using OpenCV, extracts the object's edges 
using the Canny edge detection algorithm, and classifies it as an obstacle or not using the ANN model. 
The system can be used in real-time with a computer and camera setup, making it suitable for various applications such as robotics, 
security, and surveillance. Compared to other obstacle detection methods like LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors, and structured light sensors, 
the laser line projection-based system offers advantages in terms of cost, real-time detection, larger detection range, and the ability 
to differentiate between different types of obstacles.
